# HealthPredict
HealthPredict aims to leverage Machine Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease and provide actionable, personalized recommendations for preventative care. By analyzing patient data, the model identifies risk levels, helping individuals and healthcare providers make informed decisions. The solution includes a web-based tool for user interaction and prediction

# Technologies
Python 3.9

# Setup Requirement
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikitlearn

To run this project you need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

# Code 
In this project we have proposed 3-different models namely
1. Feature Engineering
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier

# Data Preprocessing
1. Handling missing values.
2. Encoding categorical variable.

# Conclusion
 HealthPredict offers a scalable, impactful solution to predict and mitigate heart
 disease risk through personalized care. This system empowers users and
 healthcare providers with actionable insights, bridging the gap in preventative
 healthcare.
